Teaching Assistants
Dear students,
We have a new lineup of teaching assistants:
Zhou Chong
Jiang Yuming
Zhang Wenwei
Kelvin Chan Cheuk Kit
Zhou Shangchen
Shao Yidi
Hou Xinyu
I encourage you to interact with them in the discussion forum. They will help to answer your queries on lectures/homework/tutorial.
If you have questions that you would like a more private answer, you can send an email to ai6126@e.ntu.edu.sg. If possible, please use the discussion forum on NTULearn instead of sending an email.
Regards,
Cavan
